      <h3 class="flavor">Now, as of March 6<sup>th</sup> 2022</h3>
	<p>Last month I started the next step of my career. I changed jobs, I am now at Jellyfish.co, and I am now an Engineering Manager.</p>
	<p>This is my second go-around on the VC funded rollercoaster. At Owl I was employee ~42 leading their web efforts as an IC and I watched us grow well past 100.</p>
	<p>Now, I join Jellyfish at ~100 as a manager helping to drive the process of org growth & technical execution as outcome oriented teams.</p>
	<p>I am beyond excited for this opportunity, and if the first month is any judge I am going to enjoy working with this great group of humans very much.</p>
