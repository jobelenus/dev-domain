      <h3 class="flavor">Now, as of Sept 1<sup>st</sup> 2019</h3>
	  <p><strong>Previously</strong>, I worked with GLG for nearly a year. Me and my team got to work on one particular
	  project at scale, where I lead the migration to a new &amp; improved service we created,
	  saving $1M/yr in infrastructure costs.</p>
	  <p><strong>Now</strong>, I am working at OwlLabs, I have Product responsibilities to determine the
	  SaaS offerings our customers need to support their teams and our devices. I am also the sole Engineer
	  building the Product. If all goes well, <em>fingers crossed</em> we will be growing the team and I
	  will have a management role.</p>
	  <p>I am very excited for a high-growth role, and put my full-self into
	  such a big problem like a brand new product.</p>
