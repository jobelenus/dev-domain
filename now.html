                <p>
                    I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at GLG.
                    After nearly a decade working with the consultancy Active Frequency on mostly
                    Django systems (and a few native mobile projects), I have the opportunity to
                    now get to know NodeJS in depth in production environments. And I get to do it with
                    a team of ~200 engineers which is another opportunity for me, working with and driving
                    much larger teams and organizational culture.
