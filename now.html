      <h3 class="flavor">Now, as of March 10<sup>th</sup> 2019</h3>
      <p>I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at GLG.</p>
      <p>I was with the consultancy Active Frequency for nearly a decade. There I managed our clients and their teams directly,
        creating full business systems in Django and interactive front-end technology (and a few native mobile projects).</p>
      <p>Now, at GLG, I have the opportunity work deeply with NodeJS at scale in production environments.
        And I get to do it with a team of ~200 engineers which is another opportunity for me, working with and driving
        much larger teams and organizational culture.</p>
      <p>My mind is also busy cooking up a nice side-project. Gears are turning.</p>
