      <h3 class="flavor">Now, as of Apr 1<sup>st</sup> 2021</h3>
	  <p>I've been at OwlLabs for over a year and a half. I'm leading the Cloud team as a Principal Engineer and we're working on brand new products that are going to be shipping in the next few months. We are growing like a weed with no sense that it will slow down any time soon.</p>

	<p>It is an exciting time, with few moments to take a breath. I revel in the challenge of leading a team that is integrating with a larger Engineering department. I have areas of technical growth ahead of me, but I am honestly more interested in growing as a leader in an organization.</p>
