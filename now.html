      <h3 class="flavor">Now, as of Dec 1<sup>st</sup> 2022</h3>
	<p>I took the opportunity to transition into a Staff Engingeering IC role @ Jellyfish.co.</p>
	<p>Most of my goals remain the same, I am just approaching them from a different angle, while still having my hands in the technology.</p>
	<p>We've expanded a ton in my first 10 months here, number of folks at the company, number of customers, size of customers. You name it and  we have a lot more now.</p>
	<p>All of it crystalizes the opportunity of the socio-technical challenge in front of us. How to train up & grow people to rebuild a larger plane while its flying.</p>
	<h3>Long Live the Startup Plane of Theseus!</h3>
