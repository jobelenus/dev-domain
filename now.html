  <p>This is quite literally the single best team of people I have ever worked with. Which makes the prospect of growing the team, which is always exciting, a little sad. It will never be like this again.</p>
	<p>At System Initiative, we have publically launched the product. Which means quickly addressing issues of quality and limitations in both technical and product areas. I am glad to report that my skills in that area are greatly appreciated.</p>
	<h3>Long Live the Startup Plane of Theseus!</h3>
  <p>Personally, I have been boxing on a heavy bag for a year now. It is excellent exercise and very theraputic. I still get out on a long bike ride every once in a while. Day to day life is focused on my wife, doggos, and keeping up the house and yard.</p>
