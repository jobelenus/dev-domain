      <h3 class="flavor">Now, as of Apr 1<sup>st</sup> 2020</h3>
	  <p>This is quite an upheaval we are all experiencing for the last month. It is tough to consistently find the energy
      that used to be available. But we're all getting through.</p>
    <p>I've been at OwlLabs for 7 months now and cannot wait to see what the future holds for us as a company..
      The projects I have been working on are exciting, and I've been able to build out a chunk
    of tech that I can't talk about, yet.</p>
    <p>Personally I am diving more into Svelte. I honestly think it is the future. I am going to be working
    on exploring just how powerful the world of modern development can be, with as little code as possible. And if
    I keep my nerve, I'll be livestreaming coding sessions on building applications with Svelte.</p>
