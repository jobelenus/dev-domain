<h2>General Numbers</h2>
<p>Most news outlets have frozen their digital voting tools. Cook Political continues to update vote totals as they come in across CA, OR, NY, and a few other places.</p>

<p>Trump got 2 million more voters (76 million) than in his last two campaigns (74 million). Harris got 8 million fewer votes than Biden in 2020. Turnout was down in every reliably blue state by 5-9%. Turnout was up in every swing state. GA turnout increased the most. Note: 70% of white georgians have voted GOP for 30 years. They turned out in 2024 at 81%.</p>

<h2>Did the Country Move To the Right?</h2>

<p>My conclusion is no. Here is why.</p>

<p>I personally crunched numbers in the swing states that had Senate races (this means I ignored NC) with data from Nov 11th. You can calculate how many people voted for only a presidential candidate by comparing the total votes for Senate candidates against the total for Presidential candidates. Nearly one million votes were cast for only a Presidential candidate across six states (MN, WI, MI, PA, NV, AZ). My blanket assumption is that nearly all of those were Trump votes since in 5 of 6 Senate races the Democrat won (PA went GOP by 40k votes, a very tight race).</p>

<p>8 of 10 abortion ballot measures won clear majorities (only FL won't go into effect because it only got 57% of the vote, not 60%). Anti-discrimination ballot measures won. Minimum wage ballot measures won. In general, progressive politics got clear majorities in many states. However, CA was the only state to not win progressive causes; they did not overturn a ban on rent control policies, did not raise their minimum wage, and did not remove involuntary servitude as punishment for crime.</p>

<p>Many Trump voters outside his base view him as a moderate. They don't believe his bluster. They project their views onto him, because he has no clear principles and is flexible. The fact that he consistently contradicts himself is strategically useful—people pick which side of the issue they prefer, and assume that is his position.</p>

<h2>Are Democrats Too Woke?</h2>

<p>This argument is seemingly everywhere right now. It does not make any sense to me. Harris did not run on socially progressive issues in this race. She rarely, if ever, spoke about trans people in her campaign. Abortion was a part of the campaign—but it was not a centerpiece. She underran support for abortion by 7-10pts. She campaigned on a lethal military. She campaigned to reach out to republican voters. Of course Trump scared bigots about Harris, but the majority of voters swayed by that were never seriously considered as potential Harris voters.</p>

<p>More evidence against this theory is that many LGBTQ democrats won their races in states like MD, NY, TX, WA, WI, VT, MI, IL, NH, KS, MN. In addition a trans women won a county race in Kentucky. In a twist of irony, Torres an LGBTQ candidate, is one of the loudest voices claiming the Democrats are too woke. He won his district in NYC (NY-15) by 55pts, and Harris won by 45pts. Harris underperforming by 10pts in the Bronx is a message—but it is hard to claim it is because of social issues.</p>

<h2>Its The Economy</h2>

<p>The electorate have been trained to say "inflation" when the prices of goods are too high. It is irrelevant that inflation is down 7pts, back to regular lows of 2.1%. Every major race in 2024 in the Western world saw incumbents lose. Because of the economy. Voters will always vote for the opposition candidate in this situation. While racism and misogyny absolutely played a role in this election, I truly believe if it were a cis white male candidate that said every single word Harris said—they would also lose.</p>

<p>Half the country is one paycheck away from serious economic pain. Despite lowering unemployment, lowering inflation, increasing wages, and plenty of stock market gains, people are in precarity. To deny that is political suicide. Which the Democrats happily perform everytime they talk about the success of their economic policies.</p>

<p>There was plenty of good economic policy in Harris' campaign. I do not understand the idea that "Democrats turned their back on working people." I don't see it that way. If we're talking about policy, that statement is wrong. If we're talking about "there are no working class people in the party", that is much closer to the truth.</p>

<p>Voters perception about the economy is fully tinted by partisanship. Once Biden won in 2020, Democrats immediately felt better about the COVID economy, despite serious problems, and zero changes. In less than 6 months we will see Trump's supporters change their tune about how great the economy is.</p>

<p>Biden's desire to declare and end to COVID and get one in the win column led to bad economic decisions. Roughly a dozen social safety net programs that were put in place ended between 2021 and 2023. Voters remember losing benefits at the ballot box.</p>

<h2>People Hate Democrats</h2>

<p>The Democratic party brand is the "Professional Managerial Class". Harris' core constituency is highly educated high income people. How many people hate their manager? How many people like corporate speak? Especially in an era of growing income inequality and years of layoffs.</p>

<p>There are dozens of polls that show when you explain policy to people they choose Harris' policy 60/40 over Trump's. People do not vote on policy, much to my chagrin. It does not matter if you have good policy when you explain it to people with corporate speak, like a manager. Like you know what is good for them.</p>

<p>Here is a great example. Harris put forth one of *the most* progressive taxation ideas I have ever heard. More progressive than Bernie, AOC, anyone. She wanted to tax unrealized capital gains. That is so far outside the Overton window to the left it is hard to describe. The problem is: the vast majority of the voters have no idea what it means! And Democrats cannot explain it in a way they doesn't make them look like the asshole professor.</p>

<p>Whether its true or false, people believe Democrats are the people in the capital of Hunger Games. Sometimes it is very true. But Democrats do not even try to play against type here, they walk right into it constantly.</p>

<h2>Narrative since 2008</h2>

<p>This graphic tells the whole story in terms of numbers. This image breaks down the electorate into four quandrants, and describes how their voting patterns changed.</p>

    Note the axis markers of 10%. Most movements are less than 10% change in any direction, except for 2016 and 2024. Also, this demonstrates Biden's 2020 win as an aberation I will explore more below.

</figure>

<p>Here is the narrative I am constructing that explains where we have been and where we are going.</p>

<p>In 2008 we see "the Obama coalition". The Pod Save crew talks about this ad nasuem. If you take the label off it, what they're talking about is capturing a solid margin of both lower income lower education voters and lower income high education voters. These two groups make up an overhwleming portion of the voting populace.</p>

<p>Trump's first victory in 2016 should have been the wake up call that this coaltion no longer existed. But Democratic leadership focused on 400,00 votes in three states and called his victory an aberation. Can't happen again. What they should have seen is that Obama's presidency did not live up to Hope and Change.</p>

<p>Biden's win in 2020 is the aberation in my eyes. The electorate decided to pick the most stable thing they could find: a man with five decades in politics and a previous VP. COVID won the race for Biden. We needed an adult in a time of absolute chaos. That gets him an astonishing popular vote victory even while the electoral college was closer.</p>

<p>Harris' popularity was manufactured. Voter turnout tells you that. She ran as the incumbent. When asked if she would do anything different from the last four years, her answer was "I cannot think of a single thing I would do differently." That was a deathknell. </p>

<p>Voters left after Obama did not deliver on his promises. Yes, he got the ACA passsed. Many voters want to protect the ACA, but get rid of Obamacare, without realizing its the same thing. It is hard to express how big a messaging failure that is for Democrats. But, on the whole, he did not deliver on his promises, and you cannot fool the same people twice.</p>

<p>An oversimplified look at the past would say that the Democrats have always been the party of "the system is broken and we'll improve it." That is what Carter, Bill Clinton, Obama, and Biden ran on. Typically the GOP is the party of "The system is working and we like it this way". That is what both Bush's and Romney ran on. Reagan and Trump ran on "its broken and only I can fix it". Now Hilary Clinton, Biden's second campaign, and Harris have run on "The System is working." That is a first for Democrats, and its a losing message. The entire party needs to be rebuilt</p>

<p>The Democratic leadership is wildly out of touch in this new political climate. I'm talking about Pelosi, Schumer, Biden, Obama, Clinton. I'm talking about their influencers, their consultants, their experts, people like David Axelrod, Plouffe, Podesta, et. al. And that includes the Pod Save crew, too. They came in on Obama's coattails in 2008. They won one race by 7 points, with one of the most charismatic candidates in modern times, after the Bush administration left office with under 40% favorable views in polls. And with that victory them and all their friends were in charge of each presidential run. We need to stop listening to them. They are the ones that didn't convince Biden not to run until the electorate forced him to step down. They are the ones making every campaign run to the right. They are the ones managing the Democrats brand. If you believe in meritocracy, these people had several campaigns to prove they are good at this. And they have not proved it.</p>

<p>It is a common refrain right that Harris ran an excellent campaign. A losing campaign is not an excellent one. What they're really saying is: "Harris did all the things we asked her to do very well, and she met the leadership's expectations." They're going to pat themselves on the back for following their process while they lost to the most unfavorable presidential candidate in modern history (54% unfavorable). That is not a good campaign.</p>

<p>Axelrod is currently floating Rahm Emmanuel as the guy who can get the Democrats back to winning elections. If the Democrats actually do this, they'll win another election again. One of Emmanuel's infamous quotes is "I don't care about judges." In 4 years time, Trump will have appointed more than half of SCOTUS and more than half of the entire federal judiciary. Never listen to this man.</p>

<h3>Demographics Will Not Save Us</h3>

<p>The early 2030 Census estimates show that the entire northeast, NY, CA, and IL are losing significant amounts of population. This means their electoral college votes will be lowered. TX, FL, NC, GA are all gaining population, their EC votes will increase. Young men voted for Trump 53/47, a 13 point swing from 2020. Harris got 11 fewer pts from young women, though still won their votes by 24pts. Democrats do not have structural advantages coming for presidential races.</p>

<h3>This Country Is Who We've Always Been</h3>

<p>We have always been a deeply racist and misogynist country and culture. That has never been a deal breaker for people. Minorities are expected to assimilate, and that is how they are deemed "one of the good ones" that gets to participate in America. Electoral politics will not, cannot, resolve this problem.</p>

<p>We have a rich history of blaming minorities for our problems. I refuse to say that the reason Harris lost is because of any single minority group, or adding them all together, lost her the election. If you take only women's votes, Harris gets 413 votes in the electoral college. If you take out low-educated while make voters, Harris gets over 500 electoral votes.</p>

<p>We do not vote for vague concepts like "Democracy". It is too ephemeral, and there is precious little about daily life that is democratic. We can't comprehend it, until we lose it. While Harris campaigned on it, there were clear signs they didn't believe Trump was the existential threat they call him. Democrats passed on every single opportunity to do anything more than talk about him as a threat. They waited years to prosecute. After Jan6 even Republicans like Mitch McConnell were on the side of prosecuting him. And Biden declared that we won't be investigating him. And now that Trump has won, Biden is shaking his hand in the oval office with a grin from ear to ear.</p>

<p>America is not, and will not be, a multi-racial democracy. Since 1965 there has been "on paper" legal equality. We all know that actually equality has never been achieved. And with Trump's presidency the idea that it can be achieved is likely never. We've already seen the rolling back of civil rights long fought for. That will continue. Fewer and fewer politicians believe running on that platform is a winning strategy.</p>

<p>We had roughly 45 years of the New Deal ('32-'78). We made progress on civil rights for roughly 60 years ('65-'23) before the gutting the VRA, Dobbs, and Students for Fair Admissions decision. Now a second term of Trump.</p>

<p>People know that this system Does Not Work For Them. And that is all people, white people, black people, brown people, men, women. They voted for the guy who knows how to get his. And they hope they'll get theirs too. They voted for their wallets, knowing it may not even work. And even if it doesn't work—they know that nobody is getting extra help. We're all on even playing ground, though clearly that is not true.</p>

<p>Even this explains minorities voting for Trump. Why would they vote for such a racist candidate? They don't have a choice to not vote for one given our history! They're not voting "for" it. It is irrelevant. They don't believe any candidate is actually committed to anti-racism stances.And why would they?</p>

<p>On the topic of deportation they believe he'll only deport criminals. Each person is the good guy in their own story. They won't get deported. Just deport the people that skipped the line at immigration. "I am the exception".</p>

<h2>The Future</h2>

<p>I don't have high hopes for the Democratic party to break this cycle. Even if they did win this election. A reckoning was bound to happen. There are far too many structural barriers. And they are determined to "run to the right" when the going gets tough. Voters have no incentive to choose "Republican lite" when they can choose the real deal in Trump. And those of us with unwavering progressive values are left out in the cold.</p>

<p>In terms of economics neither party is committed to making a system that works for everyone. That will never be achieved. I am working on the best way to articulate and explain why I believe that. If thats something you're interested in please contact me (jobelenus@gmail.com).</p>

<p>We are stuck in a loop where voters will continue to prioritize opposition candidates. This will create chaos as each party continues to undo each other's achievements, rowing in opposite directions, achieving very little. And there is nothing on the horizon that will pierce the veil of information bubbles on either side. In this country 21% of Americans are illiterate, and 54% have literacy below a 6th grade level. And that is just in terms of reading, not even media literacy, how to determine trustworthiness of news sources, etc.</p>

<p class="flavor">Don't feel smug. There are two bubbles, a liberal one too. I advocate you find a way out of it. Stop listening to the pundits.</b></p>

<p>To summarize the difference between leftism and liberalism:</p>
<blockquote>
    ...the leftist position is that people's positions, even if horrific, have roots in the material reality. the liberal position is that 20-30% of the country has an irredeemably evil soul. I guess I'm going with the one you can actually do something about...
